Both of my parents played college ball and taught me everything when I was young. My father, Perky, played at Tennessee Tech and my mom, Leslie, played at Purdue. We tried a lot of sports growing up and other after school activities, but basketball was my love.",

We helped with various chores around the farm.

People ask me what it was like growing up in a small town. Life mostly revolved around family; playing sports and having fun with my siblings. I have an older brother Miles, younger brother Marshall and younger sister, Madeline. We did almost everything together and remain very close. I attended Jefferson Elementary School and have great memories of my principal Denny Duncan. He was the first person to tell me he was going to watch me play basketball in college one day.",
        "Swimming was a big part of my life going into middle school. I competed at the Junior Olympics in the individual medley and 100m breaststroke. Unfortunately swimming was the same season as basketball, so it was difficult to balance both sports. I knew from an early age that basketball was my passion. Indiana is a basketball state and an ideal place to grow up as a young player. My brothers and I spent our childhood playing together, which included plenty of 1-on-1 with Miles. My parents sacrificed to send us to summer camps and make a lot of opportunities possible through basketball.",

The travel was an experience, but it was more fun to compete against the best players in the country and know how we measured up. We had a lot of memorable moments together on and off the court in places like Las Vegas, Orlando and Arkansas. Later, I played for Indiana Elite which had some of the top young players from the state."

The Covid pandemic cut the NBA regular season short in March and in many ways, the NBA suspending its season was the wake-up call that made the pandemic a reality in the US. The NBA was also the first league to re-start play and we headed to Orlando in July to complete our season in a "bubble." Adam Silver and Michele Roberts deserve a ton of credit for their leadership in helping to pull off what few believed could happen -- a successful, safe return of pro sports and an exciting conclusion to our season.
